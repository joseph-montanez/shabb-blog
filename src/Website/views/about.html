					Hello, my name is Joseph Montanez and I am an artistic programmer, living in sunny San Diego, California as an more then full-time web developer. My main focus is developing frameworks for rapid / agile applications. From those aspects most of my work is Social Media Development and E-commerce Web Apps. I push myself into a lot of areas including game programming and design. What I spend on my free-time isn't work, its life and when I am working its not work, its my free-time.

				<h3 class="heading">How I started</h3>
				<p>
					I can certainly say that I never intended to focus my career in web development. It started all from
					a video game called "Final Fantasy 7", which I didn't get to play until 1998. After playing my first 3D
					game I was memorized by the story and graphics, so much so that I would spend the next 6 years trying
					to reach the goal of creating my own video game. I was 12 when I played that game, and at the age of 13
					I had created my first website dedicated to drawing pictures for people. I went through middle school and
					high school having gone days without sleep learning to write code in quick basic, visual basic, c#, 
					then python. Python won over my heart with its powerful language features and simplicity. 
				</p><p>
					At the age of 16 I got my first job washing dishes at a retirement home and I used that money to play a video game called Ultima Online, which was a massive multiplayer online game. I became so addicted to the game that I too wanted to create a game with the ability to play online. There is a lot to a video game, including music and art. Those two skills would become a journey to creating a game. My artwork was getting better and better every year, with my drawings ending up on people's notebooks and many more requests would come in about drawing some unique character for them. The ability to effect someone's happiness with a 15 minute sketch gave me such a strong desire to push further. So my programming goal started to shift. I spent my time programming tools in Blender 3D to help myself create artwork, including the Blender 3D Game Engine.
				</p><p>
					Up until I was 19 all I cared about was being a video game artist, all my programming skills, website design, and development were all a second coming to that goal. I had hit against a lot of road blocks, I lost my little brother to cancer, there were no services to "Game Artist" in my local school, much less programming. I started freelancing at 16 doing design and html work, but those were very low paying jobs and my 3D skills were no use in that area. To make matters worst I had issues finding a college since no colleges (community and state) had any fields for studying to become a video game artist. The colleges that did have those fields needed money that I couldn't get.
				</p><p>
					As much as I loved creating artwork, I just could not generate what I needed to live on. My mother and father split up at that point and so I needed to find a job, any job to make money, so I went back to washing dishes. I effectively put aside my dream to become an artist and focus on becoming a web developer. After all its the only skill other then washing dishes that I could make money with. I used python to create web applications, which got me more freelance work. So I'd wash dishes for minimum wage and program web application on sites like scriptlancer for 2-3 dollars an hour. Many times I never got paid, which was frustrating but expected.

				<h3 class="heading">How I Got My First Job</h3>
				<p>
					Around 20 I began submitting for web development jobs, and I can say they were brutal. With someone that has no formal education in software engineering it was very hard to make it past the first interview. How could I have been programming since 13 and have nothing to show for it. What are all these terms they are using to interview me? My resume was crap, I had no real experience much less school and I didn't even know the right terms. The only way I would get a job is if lightening hit me... Well I can say, it never did. I saw an opening for HTML work, part time. I was hugely over qualified for the job but having nothing but my free-time / freelance work, I had no choice but to go for it. He asked me question like what HTML tags were for and if I knew javascript / css. I ended up getting the job, on the merit of him liking my humbleness and honesty. With the first day I ran out of work, everything he gave me I was able to complete in a record time. So he started to give me programming work and again finished it in record time.
				</p>
				<p>
					That job is what got me started, but there are some things to take away from this. I applied for jobs well beneath my ability. I also applied for jobs that paid very low wages for the experience even requested. I also had an extensive portfolio, and a horrible resume or cover letter.
